# txtChromeBookmark (_not_finished_)
Chrome extention to bookmark websites into a simple txt format
- the bookmarks save and show up when clicked on save button
- the bookmarks are saved in memory and survive just one chrome session - then they are deleted

WHY txtChromeBookmark?
- to "select" a bunch of websites and then be able to copy paste them into a .txt file
- feel free to propose other usefull cases ... ( I'am seeing just the first one)

thanks ;)
